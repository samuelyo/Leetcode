		 * scan from left to right, and record counts of unpaired ¡®(¡¯ for all
		 * possible cases. For ¡®(¡¯ and ¡®)¡¯, it is straightforward, just
		 * increment and decrement all counts, respectively. When the character
		 * is '*', there are three cases, ¡®(¡¯, empty, or ¡®)¡¯, we can think those
		 * three cases as three branches in the ongoing route. Take ¡°(**())¡± as
		 * an example. There are 6 chars: ----At step 0: only one count = 1.
		 * ----At step 1: the route will be diverted into three branches. so
		 * there are three counts: 1 - 1, 1, 1 + 1 which is 0, 1, 2, for ¡®)¡¯,
		 * empty and ¡®(¡¯ respectively. ----At step 2 each route is diverged into
		 * three routes again. so there will be 9 possible routes now. -- For
		 * count = 0, it will be diverted into 0 ¨C 1, 0, 0 + 1, which is -1, 0,
		 * 1, but when the count is -1, that means there are more ¡®)¡¯s than
		 * ¡®(¡¯s, and we need to stop early at that route, since it is invalid.
		 * we end with 0, 1. -- For count = 1, it will be diverted into 1 ¨C 1,
		 * 1, 1 + 1, which is 0, 1, 2 -- For count = 2, it will be diverted into
		 * 2 ¨C 1, 2, 2 + 1, which is 1, 2, 3 To summarize step 2, we end up with
		 * counts of 0,1,2,3 ----At step 3, increment all counts --> 1,2,3,4
		 * ----At step 4, decrement all counts --> 0,1,2,3 ----At step 5,
		 * decrement all counts --> -1, 0,1,2, the route with count -1 is
		 * invalid, so stop early at that route. Now we have 0,1,2. In the very
		 * end, we find that there is a route that can reach count == 0. Which
		 * means all ¡®(¡¯ and ¡®)¡¯ are cancelled. So, the original String is
		 * valid. Another finding is counts of unpaired ¡®(¡¯ for all valid routes
		 * are consecutive integers. So we only need to keep a lower and upper
		 * bound of that consecutive integers to save space. One case doesn¡¯t
		 * show up in the example is: if the upper bound is negative, that means
		 * all routes have more ¡®)¡¯ than ¡®(¡¯ --> all routes are invalid --> stop
		 * and return false.
