	// If n has alternating bits, then (n>>1) + n must be like 111...11.

	// Now, let's consider the case when n does not have alternating bits, that
	// is, n has at least one subsequence with continuous 1 or 0 (we assume n
	// has continuous 1 in the after) . We write n in its binary format as
	// xxx011...110xxx, where xxx0 and 0xxx could be empty. Denote A as xxx0, B
	// as 11...11 and C as 0xxx, n then can be expressed as ABC. We can observe
	// that,
	//
	// If the leftmost bit of C + C>>1 is 1, then the leftmost two bits of
	// C+(1C)>>1 is 10. E.g., if C = 011, then C + (1C)>>1 = 011 + 101 = 1000.
	// So n + (n>>1) will have a bit with 0.
	// If the leftmost bit of C + C>>1 is 0, then the leftmost two bits of
	// 1C+(11C)>>1 is also 10. E.g., if C = 010, then 1C + (11C)>>1 = 1010 +
	// 1101 = 10111. Note that B has a length of at least 2. So n + (n>>1) will
	// also have a bit with 0.
	// Therefore, if n does not have alternating bits, then (n>>1) + n must Not
	// be like 111...11. Then, we just need to check if (n>>1) + n + 1 is power
	// of 2.
